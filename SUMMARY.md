LogCabin currently only implements the memory-based snapshotting approach (it embeds a memory- based state machine).
The various approaches to compaction share several core concepts. First, instead of centralizing compaction decisions on the leader, each server compacts the committed prefix of its log indepen- dently. This avoids having the leader transmit data to followers that already have the data in their logs. It also helps modularity: most of the complexity of log compaction is contained within the state machine and does not interact much with Raft itself. This helps keep overall system complex- ity to a minimum: the complexity of Raft adds to, rather than multiplies with, the complexity of log compaction. Alternative approaches that centralize compaction responsibilities on a leader are discussed further in Section 5.4 (and for very small state machines, a leader-based approach may be better).
